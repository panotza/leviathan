Linux device drivers that support controlling and monitoring NZXT Kraken water coolers

NZXT is **NOT** involved in this project, do **NOT** contact them if your device is damaged while using this software.

Also, while it doesn't seem like the hardware could be damaged by silly USB messages (apart from overheating), I do **NOT** take any responsibility for any damage done to your cooler.

# Supported devices

* Driver `kraken` (for Vendor/Product ID `2433:b200`)
  * NZXT Kraken X61 
  * NZXT Kraken X41
  * NZXT Kraken X31 (Only for controlling the fan/pump speed, since there's no controllable LED on the device)
* Driver `kraken_x62` (for Vendor/Product ID `1e71:170e`)
  * NZXT Kraken X72 *[?]*
  * NZXT Kraken X62
  * NZXT Kraken X52 *[?]*
  * NZXT Kraken X42
  * NZXT Kraken M22 *[?]*

A *[?]* indicates that the device should be compatible based on the product specifications, but has not yet been tested with the driver and is therefore currently unsupported.

If you have an unsupported liquid cooler — whether it is present in the above list or not — and want to help out, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

# Installation
Make sure the headers for the kernel you are running are installed.

To build the drivers:
```Shell
make
```

To install the driver temporarily (until the next reboot):
```Shell
sudo insmod $DRIVER.ko
```
where `$DRIVER` is the name of the driver, i.e. either `kraken` or `kraken_x62`.

To install the driver permanently across reboots:
```Shell
sudo cp $DRIVER.ko /lib/modules/$VERSION/kernel/drivers/usb && sudo depmod && sudo modprobe $DRIVER
```
where `$VERSION` is the kernel version you're using, e.g. `4.16.0-2-amd64`.
After this, the driver should automatically load on boot.

**Note**: This is not permanent across kernel versions.
The process needs to be repeated whenever you upgrade your kernel — just move the `$DRIVER.ko` file into the new kernel version's `kernel/drivers/usb` directory and load with `modprobe`.

## Checking the installation

Run
```Shell
sudo dmesg
```
Near the bottom you should see `usbcore: registered new interface driver $DRIVER` or a similar message.
If your cooler is connected, then directly above this line you should see `$DRIVER 1-7:1.0: Kraken connected` or similar.
If you see both messages, the installation was successful, and there should be a directory for your cooler device's attributes in `/sys/bus/usb/drivers/$DRIVER`, e.g. `/sys/bus/usb/drivers/$DRIVER/1-7:1.0`.

## Troubleshooting `kraken_x62`

The most common issue with `kraken_x62` is the device not connecting after installation.
This is usually caused by module `usbhid` being already connected to the cooler.
To fix it, create a file `/etc/modprobe.d/usbhid-kraken-ignore.conf` with the contents
```
# 1e71:170e is the NZXT Kraken X*2 coolers
# 0x4 is HID_QUIRK_IGNORE
options usbhid quirks=0x1e71:0x170e:0x4
```
Then reload the `usbhid` module
```Shell
sudo modprobe -r usbhid && sudo modprobe usbhid
```
(You should be careful unloading USB modules as it may make your USB devices (keyboard etc.) unresponsive; therefore it's best to type all the commands out on a single line before executing them, like above.)
Also update initramfs to keep the configuration across reboots
```Shell
sudo update-initramfs -u
```

Finally reload the driver with
```Shell
sudo rmmod kraken_x62; sudo insmod kraken_x62.ko
```
or
```Shell
sudo modprobe -r kraken_x62; sudo modprobe kraken_x62
```
depending on how it was installed.

## Troubleshooting the general case

If you don't see any messages about the `$DRIVER` in `dmesg` then something went wrong and you should consider reporting it as a bug.
If you see a long, scary error message from the kernel (stacktrace, registry dump, etc.), the driver crashed and your kernel is in an invalid state; you should restart your computer before doing anything else (also consider doing any further testing of the driver in a virtual machine so you won't have to restart after each crash).

If you see the `registered new interface driver` message but not the `Kraken connected` or similar message, it is probably one of three possibilities:
* The cooler is not connected or not connected properly to the motherboard: check if it's connected properly / try reconnecting it.
* The cooler is not supported by the driver: see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
* Another kernel USB module is already connected to the cooler, so the driver cannot connect to it: see [section Troubleshooting `kraken_x62`](#troubleshooting-kraken_x62).

# Usage
Each driver can be controlled with device files under `/sys/bus/usb/drivers/$DRIVER`, where `$DRIVER` is the driver name.
Each attribute `$ATTRIBUTE` for a device `$DEVICE` is exposed to the user through the file `/sys/bus/usb/drivers/$DRIVER/$DEVICE/$ATTRIBUTE`.

Find the symbolic links that point to the connected compatible devices.
In my case, there's only one Kraken connected.
```Shell
/sys/bus/usb/drivers/$DRIVER/2-1:1.0 -> ../../../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:06.0/usb2/2-1/2-1:1.0
```

## Changing the update interval
Attribute `update_interval` is the number of milliseconds elapsed between successive USB update messages.
This is mainly useful for debugging; you probably don't need to change it from the default value.
The minimum interval is 500 ms — anything smaller is silently changed to 500.
A special value of 0 indicates that no USB updates are sent.
```Shell
$ cat /sys/bus/usb/drivers/$DRIVER/$DEVICE/update_interval
1000
$ echo $INTERVAL > /sys/bus/usb/drivers/$DRIVER/$DEVICE/update_interval
```
